1) Read in every line of the text file fox-in-socks.txt into a collection.

2) Can you iterate over all the lines and display them in the console.

3) Someone has sabotaged the file and added duplicate line entries. Can you use a collection that deletes the duplicates but maintains the order? (It's OK to remove the empty lines)

4) Can you use a collection to sort the lines into alphabetical order?

5) Change the code to a list and write your own code to remove any duplicate lines? (Note how computer intensive this can be).

6) Display the lines in the correct order without duplicates.

7) Display every third line only.

Bonus points:
8)  Can you save your output to a new file.
