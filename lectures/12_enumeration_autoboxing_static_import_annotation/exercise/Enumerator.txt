1) Create an enumerator for the months of the year based on their english 3 character name e.g. JAN , FEB etc.
2) Extend your enumerator so it has a private variable for the monthNumber.
3) Create a constructor in your enumerator to set the numerical number of the month and change the list of constants so they set this value i.e. JAN(1).
4) Create a public method getMonthNumber to return the private variable monthNumber.

5) Create a new class to test your Months enumerator. 
6) Use values() method to print out all months and there monthNumber.
7) Create a currentMonth variable of type Months. Set it's value using the valueOf() method to be the value of the String argument[0] in the arguments array sent to your main method. Use try and catch to handle any possible exceptions.
8) Create a switch on currentMonth and print to the terminal the season of the month i.e. "Winter", "Spring", "Autumn", "Summer"
7) Create another Months variable and set it to April. 
8) Use the compareTo() method and a 3 if statements to print if the currentMonth is before, after or equal to April.
